# **App Name**: Simple Encryption/Decryption Tool

## Core Features:

- Input Text: Accepts text input from the user for encryption or decryption, sanitizing or ignoring spaces as the primary method of data cleansing before beginning the selected operation.
- Encryption: Encrypts the input text using Caesar cipher or ASCII shifting. Applies modular arithmetic for wrapping around the alphabet.
- Decryption: Decrypts the encrypted text using Caesar cipher or ASCII shifting, reversing the encryption process.
- Shift Value: Allows users to input a value by which to shift during the encryption or decryption process, making it an effective tool for users wanting a specific type of encoding.
- Display output: Presents the encrypted or decrypted output in a readable and formatted manner.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A medium blue (#4681C4) to complement the dark background while providing sufficient contrast.
- Background color: Dark blue (#192841) for a user-friendly interface in low-light conditions.
- Accent color: Light orange (#FFA500) to highlight key UI elements like buttons and interactive components.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used throughout the application to maintain consistency. The font is very readable which helps make it very accessible for users with impaired vision.
- Simple, geometric icons to represent encryption/decryption actions.
- Clean and straightforward layout to ensure ease of use. Use card based UI for options like shift value and encoding methods.
- Subtle transitions for button presses and encryption/decryption processes.
